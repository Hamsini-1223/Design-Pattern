Singleton Pattern: Ensure a single instance of certain classes and provide a global point of access to it.

Centralized Management: Ensures that there is a single instance of classes that manage global states or resources, such as configuration settings, logging, or database connections. This is particularly useful for managing centralized services or resources that should not be duplicated.
